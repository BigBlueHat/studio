# Models

## What 
A model contains common reusable information that can be referenced in your endpoint definitions or other models in your API design. The resources or endpoints in your API project might contain duplicate structures and response objects. Models reduce this duplication by helping you extract and define common resources making your project easier to maintain. 

## Best Practices 

### Avoid Cluttered APIs
When you have several endpoints with the same structure, objects, and properties, your API design is untidy. Ensure that you extract reusable artifacts and build them as pragmatic models referenced by other resources within your API project. 

### Use a Design First Approach
A design first approach helps create neat and consistent models. It will take longer, but it ensures you built an effective API that is easy to understand and maintain.
