# Welcome to Stoplight Studio 

Stoplight is proud to present the next generation of our API modeling software, Stoplight Studio. Stoplight Studio has everything you loved in Stoplight Classic and Stoplight Next with an abundance of new features to meet the needs of the present and future API modeling workflows. Some of the principal new features you may notice include: 

### Customizable Three Column Interface 
Customize your interface to meet your needs. The three main panels in Studio can display an array of different information so that you can choose what you need. Expand a panel to focus on one task. 

### Robust Search 
Filter resources by type, activity, or tags to quickly find the files you need. Search through files for specific phrases, operations, parameters, and much more. 

### New File Explorer
View resources via three separate modes: Table of Contents, Traditional File Tree, or all Unsaved Files. Filter resources to files related to the API you are working on. 

Now letâ€™s get to modeling!
