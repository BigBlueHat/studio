# File Explorer

## What 

Studio provides multiple methods for organizing and viewing your files. You can now easily switch between Project and API specific resources and multiple view modes (Table of Contents, traditional file tree, unsaved resources, and nodes specific to the active API.)  

## How 

1. Select a **Project**
2. Select an **API** for API specific resources 
3. Toggle between **view modes** by selecting one of the icons in the top left of the file explorer window 
4. Filter resources to only nodes included in the active API by selecting the icon in the top right of the file explorer window
