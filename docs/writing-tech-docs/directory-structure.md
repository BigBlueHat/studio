# Directory Structure (Documentation) 

![]()

## What 

### Files Created Within Studio
Stoplight Studio’s directory structure (aka file tree structure) organizes and displays accessible files in Studio. Documentation specific files (markdown and image files) can be viewed within the File tree **Docs** tab and all files can be viewed within the **Files** tab.

### Files Uploaded to Studio
To publish and modify Markdown files created outside of the Studio UI , they must be stored within the **docs** folder. To publish and modify images created outside of the Studio UI, they must be stored within the **assets/images** folder. 

>These folders are automatically generated for any instance of Stoplight Studio
